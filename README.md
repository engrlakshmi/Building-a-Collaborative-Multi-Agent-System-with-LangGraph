# Building-a-Collaborative-Multi-Agent-System-with-LangGraph
ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent System with LangGraph and Hugging Face Pipelines
This project demonstrates a collaborative multi-agent system using https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph and Hugging Face Transformers. It includes summarization, question answering, and chat generation agents orchestrated in a graph-based workflow.

ðŸ§  Agent Definitions
This system includes three specialized agents, each responsible for a distinct task in the workflow:

1. Summarizer Agent
Uses a Hugging Face summarization pipeline to condense the input text.
2.  Question Answering (QA) Agent
Answers a predefined question based on the summary or original input.
3. Chat Agent
Generates a conversational response based on the input text.
